## Project Overview
The Olympic Games 2024 Football Simulator is a web application built using Vue.js. It aims to provide users with an interactive way to simulate the football matches, update scores, and visualize the progression of teams from the group stages to the finals.

### Homepage Overview
Upon arrival, users land on the homepage, which contains all essential information about the 2024 Olympic Football tournament.
A prominent button in the center of the page invites users to proceed to the simulator.

üëá The image below does not show the entire page. Under the button, you will find information about 'About the Olympic Games', 'Football at the Olympics', 'Group Stage', 'Knockout Stage', 'Historical Context', 'Key Dates', and 'Additional Information'.

### Group Stage Overview
Clicking the button takes users to the simulator, where they can see an overview of all group stage matches.
Users can enter their predictions for each match. It is mandatory to provide a prediction for every match to ensure comprehensive participation.
Once predictions are made, users validate their scores and proceed by clicking on "Go to the Quarter Finals."

The system automatically generates standings based on the user‚Äôs predictions, displaying rankings for each of the four groups. The top two teams from each group advance to the quarterfinals as follows:
- 1A vs. 2B
- 1B vs. 2A
- 1C vs. 2D
- 1D vs. 2C

### Quarter Finals to Finals Predictions
On the next page, a blank knockout bracket is presented with the qualified teams from the quarterfinals.
Users are free to input their predictions for each match up to the final and the third-place match.
Upon completion, the system generates a podium displaying Gold, Silver, and Bronze winners based on the user‚Äôs predictions.
A "screenshot" button is provided for users to capture their predictions and share them with friends.

üëá As you can see below, all scores must be validated before you can input scores for the next round, and so on. The screenshot button and the podium will not appear until the third-place match and the final have been validated.
